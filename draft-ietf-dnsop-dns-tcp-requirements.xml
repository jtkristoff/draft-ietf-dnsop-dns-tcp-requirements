   <abstract>
     <t>This document encourages the practice of permitting DNS messages to
     be carried over TCP on the Internet.
     This includes both DNS over unencrypted TCP, as well as over an encrypted TLS session.
     The document also considers the consequences
     with this form of DNS communication and the potential operational issues
     that can arise when this best current practice is not upheld.</t>

   <section title="Introduction">
     <t>DNS messages may be delivered using UDP or TCP communications.
     While most DNS transactions are carried over UDP, some operators
     have been led to believe that any DNS over TCP traffic is unwanted
     or unnecessary for general DNS operation.  When DNS over TCP has
     been restricted, a variety of communication failures and debugging
     challenges often arise.  As DNS and new naming system features have
     evolved, TCP as a transport has become increasingly important for
     the correct and safe operation of an Internet DNS.  Reflecting
     modern usage, the DNS standards were recently updated to declare
     support for TCP is now a required part of the DNS implementation
     specifications <xref target="RFC7766"></xref>.  This document is the
     formal requirements equivalent for the operational community,
     encouraging system administrators, network engineers, and security
     staff to ensure DNS over TCP communications support is on par with
     DNS over UDP communications.</t>

       <t>The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL

       described in BCP 14 <xref target="RFC2119"/> <xref target="RFC8174"/> when, and only when, they
       appear in all capitals, as shown here.</t>

   </section>

   <section title="History of DNS over TCP">
     <t>The curious state of disagreement in operational best practices
     and guidance for DNS transport protocols derives from conflicting
     messages operators have gotten from other operators, implementors,
     and even the IETF.  Sometimes these mixed signals have been
     explicit, on other occasions they have suspiciously implicit.  This
     section presents an interpretation of the storied and conflicting
     history that led to this document.</t>

     <section title="Uneven Transport Usage and Preference">
       <t>In the original suite of DNS specifications, <xref
       target="RFC1034"></xref> and <xref target="RFC1035"></xref>
       clearly specified that DNS messages could be carried in either
       UDP or TCP, but they also stated a preference for UDP as the
       best transport for queries in the general case.  As stated in
       <xref target="RFC1035"></xref>:
       <list hangIndent="10" style="empty">
         <t>"While virtual circuits can be used for any DNS activity,
         datagrams are preferred for queries due to their lower overhead
         and better performance."</t>
       </list>
       </t>

       <t>Another early, important, and influential document,
       <xref target="RFC1123"></xref>, marked the preference for a
       transport protocol more
       explicitly:<list hangIndent="10" style="empty">
         <t>"DNS resolvers and recursive servers MUST support UDP, and
         SHOULD support TCP, for sending (non-zone-transfer) queries."
         </t>
       </list>
       and further stipulated:<list hangIndent="10" style="empty">
         <t>"A name server MAY limit the resources it devotes to TCP
         queries, but it SHOULD NOT refuse to service a TCP query just
         because it would have succeeded with UDP."</t>
       </list>
       </t>

       <t>Culminating in <xref target="RFC1536"></xref>, DNS over TCP
       came to be associated primarily with the zone transfer mechanism,
       while most DNS queries and responses were seen as the dominion of
       UDP.</t>
     </section>

     <section title="Waiting for Large Messages and Reliability">
       <t>In the original specifications, the maximum DNS over UDP
       message size was enshrined at 512 bytes.  However, even while
       <xref target="RFC1123"></xref> preferred UDP for non-zone transfer
       queries, it foresaw DNS over TCP becoming more popular in the
       future to overcome this limitation:<list hangIndent="10"
       style="empty">
         <t>"[...] it is also clear that some new DNS record types
         defined in the future will contain information exceeding the
         512 byte limit that applies to UDP, and hence will require
         TCP.</t>
       </list>
       </t>

       <t>At least two new, widely anticipated developments were set to
       elevate the need for DNS over TCP transactions.  The first was
       dynamic updates defined in <xref target="RFC2136"></xref> and the
       second was the set of extensions collectively known as DNSSEC,
       whose operational considerations are originally given in <xref target="RFC2541"/>.  The
       former suggested "requestors who require an accurate response
       code must use TCP," while the latter warned "... larger keys
       increase the size of KEY and SIG RRs.  This increases the chance
       of DNS UDP packet overflow and the possible necessity for using
       higher overhead TCP in responses."</t>

       <t>Yet, defying some expectations, DNS over TCP remained little-used
       in real traffic across the Internet around this time.  Dynamic updates saw
       little deployment between autonomous networks.  Around the time
       DNSSEC was first defined, another new feature helped solidify
       UDP transport dominance for message transactions.</t>
     </section>

     <section title="EDNS(0)">
       <t>In 1999 the IETF published the Extension Mechanisms for DNS
       (EDNS(0)) in <xref target="RFC2671"></xref> (superseded in 2013 by
       an update in <xref target="RFC6891"></xref>).  This document
       standardized a way for communicating DNS nodes to perform
       rudimentary capabilities negotiation.  One such capability
       written into the base specification and present in every EDNS(0)-compatible
       message is the value of the maximum UDP payload size
       the sender can support.  This unsigned 16-bit field specifies,
       in bytes, the maximum (possibly fragmented) DNS message size a
       node is capable of receiving over UDP.  In practice, typical values are
       a subset of the 512- to 4096-byte range.  EDNS(0) became
       widely deployed over the next several years and numerous surveys
       (<xref target="CASTRO2010"></xref>, <xref target="NETALYZR"></xref>)
       have shown many systems currently support larger UDP MTUs
       with EDNS(0).</t>

       <t>The natural effect of EDNS(0) deployment meant DNS messages
       larger than 512 bytes would be less reliant on TCP than they
       might otherwise have been.  While a non-negligible population of
       DNS systems lacked EDNS(0) or fell back to TCP when necessary,
       DNS over TCP transactions remained a very small fraction of
       overall DNS traffic <xref target="VERISIGN"></xref>.</t>
     </section>

     <section title="Fragmentation and Truncation">
       <t>Although EDNS(0) provides a way for endpoints to signal support for
       DNS messages exceeding 512 bytes, the realities of a diverse and
       inconsistently deployed Internet may result in some large messages
       being unable to reach their destination.  Any IP datagram whose size
       exceeds the MTU of a link it transits will be fragmented and then
       reassembled by the receiving host.  Unfortunately, it is not uncommon
       for middleboxes and firewalls to block IP fragments.  If one or more
       fragments do not arrive, the application does not receive the message
       and the request times out.</t>

       <t>For IPv4-connected hosts, the MTU is often the Ethernet
       payload size of 1500 bytes.  This means that the largest unfragmented
       UDP DNS message that can be sent over IPv4 is likely 1472 bytes,
       although tunnel encapsulation may reduce that maximum message
       size in some cases.</t>

       <t>For
       IPv6, the situation is a little more complicated.  First, IPv6 headers
       are 40 bytes (versus 20 without options in IPv4).  Second, it seems as
       though some people have mis-interpreted IPv6's required minimum MTU of
       1280 as a required maximum.  Third, fragmentation in IPv6 can only be
       done by the host originating the datagram.  The need to fragment is
       conveyed in an ICMPv6 "packet too big" message.  The originating host
       indicates a fragmented datagram with IPv6 extension headers.
       Unfortunately, it is quite common for both ICMPv6 and IPv6 extension
       headers to be blocked by middleboxes.  According to
       <xref target="HUSTON"/> some 35%<!-- 3,592 / 10,115 --> of IPv6-capable
       recursive resolvers were unable to receive a fragmented IPv6 packet.
       Even if the originating host does receive a signal that
       fragmentation is required, the stateless nature of the DNS
       protocol is such that the host does not generally retain a copy
       of the message concerned and hence is unable to fragment and
       re-send anyway.</t>

       <t>The practical consequence of all this is that DNS requestors
       must be prepared to retry queries with different EDNS(0) maximum
       message size values.  Administrators of <xref target="BIND"/> are likely to be 
       familiar with seeing "success resolving ... after reducing the
       advertised EDNS(0) UDP packet size to 512 octets" messages in their
       system logs.</t>

       <t>Often, reducing the EDNS(0) UDP packet size leads to a
       successful response.  That is, the necessary data fits within the
       smaller message size.  However, when the data does not fit, the
       server sets the truncated flag in its response, indicating the
       client should retry over TCP to receive the whole response.  This
       is undesirable from the client's point of view because it adds
       more latency and potentially undesirable from the server's point
       of view due to the increased resource requirements of TCP.</t>

       <t>The issues around fragmentation, truncation, and TCP are
       driving certain implementation and policy decisions in the DNS.
       Notably, Cloudflare implemented what it calls "DNSSEC black lies"
       <xref target="CLOUDFLARE"/> and uses ECDSA algorithms, such that
       their signed responses fit easily in 512 bytes.  The KSK Rollover
       design team <xref target="DESIGNTEAM"/> spent a lot of time
       thinking and worrying about response sizes.  There is growing
       sentiment in the DNSSEC community that RSA key sizes beyond
       2048-bits are impractical and that critical infrastructure zones
       should transition to elliptic curve algorithms to keep response
       sizes manageable <xref target="ECDSA"/>.</t>

       <t>More recently, renewed security concerns about fragmented DNS
       messages (<xref target="AVOID_FRAGS"/>, <xref target="FRAG_POISON"/>)
       are leading implementors to consider lower default EDNS(0) UDP payload
       size values for both queriers and responders <xref target="FLAGDAY2020"/>.</t>

     </section>

     <section title="&quot;Only Zone Transfers Use TCP&quot;">
       <t>Today, the majority of the DNS community expects, or at least
       has a desire, to see DNS over TCP transactions occur without
       interference.  However there has also been a long-held belief by
       some operators, particularly for security-related reasons, that
       DNS over TCP services should be purposely limited or not provided
       at all <xref target="CHES94"></xref>, <xref
       target="DJBDNS"></xref>.  A popular meme has also held the
       imagination of some: that DNS over TCP is only ever used for zone
       transfers and is generally unnecessary otherwise, with filtering
       all DNS over TCP traffic even described as a best practice.</t>

       <t>The position on restricting DNS over TCP had some
       justification given that historical implementations of DNS
       nameservers provided very little in the way of TCP connection
       management (for example see Section 6.1.2 of <xref
       target="RFC7766"></xref> for more details).  However modern
       standards and implementations are nearing parity with the more
       sophisticated TCP management techniques employed by, for example,
       HTTP(S) servers and load balancers.</t>

   <section title="DNS over TCP Requirements">
     <t>An average increase in DNS message size (e.g., due to DNSSEC),
     the continued development of new DNS features [<xref
     target="dnsrfcs"></xref>], and a denial of service mitigation
     technique [<xref target="Security"></xref>] have suggested that
     DNS over TCP transactions are as important to the correct and safe
     operation of the Internet DNS as ever, if not more so.
     Furthermore, there has been serious research that argues
     connection-oriented DNS transactions may provide security and
     privacy advantages over UDP transport. <xref target="TDNS"></xref>
     In fact <xref target="RFC7858"></xref>, a Standards Track document,
     is just this sort of specification.  Therefore, this document makes
     explicit that it is undesirable for network operators to
     artificially inhibit DNS over TCP transport.</t>

     <t>Section 6.1.3.2 in <xref target="RFC1123" /> is updated: All
     DNS resolvers and servers MUST support and service both UDP and
     TCP queries.
       <list hangIndent="10" style="symbols">
         <t>Authoritative servers MUST support and service all TCP
         queries so that they do not limit the size of responses to what
         fits in a single UDP packet.</t>
         <t>Recursive servers (or forwarders) MUST support and service
         all TCP queries so that they do not prevent large responses
         from a TCP-capable server from reaching its TCP-capable
         clients.</t>
       </list>
     Regarding the choice of limiting the resources a server devotes to
     queries, Section 6.1.3.2 in <xref target="RFC1123" /> also says:
       <list hangIndent="10" style="empty">
         <t>"A name server MAY limit the resources it devotes to TCP
         queries, but it SHOULD NOT refuse to service a TCP query just
         because it would have succeeded with UDP."</t>
       </list>
     This requirement is hereby updated: A name server MAY limit
     the resources it devotes to queries, but it MUST NOT refuse to
     service a query just because it would have succeeded with another
     transport protocol.</t>

     <t>Filtering of DNS over TCP is considered harmful in the general
     case.  DNS resolver and server operators MUST support and provide
     DNS service over both UDP and TCP transports.  Likewise, network
     operators MUST allow DNS service over both UDP and TCP transports.
     It is acknowledged that DNS over TCP service can pose operational
     challenges that are not present when running DNS over UDP alone,
     and vice-versa.  However, it is the aim of this document to argue
     that the potential damage incurred by prohibiting DNS over TCP
     service is more detrimental to the continued utility and success of
     the DNS than when its usage is allowed.</t>
   </section>

   <section title="Network and System Considerations">

   <t>This section describes measures that systems and applications
   can take to optimize performance over TCP and to protect themselves
   from TCP-based resource exhaustion and attacks.</t>

     <section title="Connection Establishment and Admission">

       <t>Resolvers and other DNS clients should be aware that some
       servers might not be reachable over TCP.  For this reason, clients
       MAY want to track and limit the number of TCP connections and
       connection attempts to a single server.  Additionally, DNS clients
       MAY want to enforce a short timeout on unestablished connections,
       rather than rely on the host operating system's TCP connection
       timeout, which is often around 60-120 seconds.</t>

       <t>The SYN flooding attack is a denial-of-service method
       affecting hosts that run TCP server processes <xref
       target="RFC4987"/>.  This attack can be very effective if
       not mitigated.  One of the most effective mitigation techniques
       is SYN cookies, which allows the server to avoid allocating
       any state until the successful completion of the three-way
       handshake.</t>

       <t>Services not intended for use by the public Internet,
       such as most recursive name servers, SHOULD be protected
       with access controls.  Ideally these controls are placed in
       the network, well before before any unwanted TCP packets can
       reach the DNS server host or application.  If this is not
       possible, the controls can be placed in the application
       itself.  In some situations (e.g. attacks) it may be necessary
       to deploy access controls for DNS services that should
       otherwise be globally reachable.  See also <xref target="RFC5358"/>.</t>

       <t>The FreeBSD, OpenBSD, and NetBSD operating systems have an "accept filter" feature
       (<xref target="accept_filter"/>)
       that postpones delivery of TCP connections to applications
       until a complete, valid request has been received.  The
       dns_accf(9) filter ensures that a valid DNS message is
       received.  If not, the bogus connection never reaches the
       application.
       The Linux TCP_DEFER_ACCEPT feature, while more limited in scope,
       can provide some of the same benefits as the BSD accept filter
       feature.
       These features are implemented as low-level socket options,
       and are not activated automatically. If applications wish to
       use these features, they need to make specific calls to set the
       right options, and administrators may also need to configure the
       applications to appropriately use the features.</t>

       <t>Per <xref target="RFC7766"/>, applications and administrators
       are advised to remember that TCP MAY be used before sending
       any UDP queries.  Networks and applications MUST NOT be configured
       to refuse TCP queries that were not preceded by a UDP query.</t>

       <t>TCP Fast Open <xref target="RFC7413"/> (TFO) allows TCP
       clients to shorten the handshake for subsequent connections
       to the same server.  TFO saves one round-trip time in the
       connection setup.  DNS servers SHOULD enable TFO when possible.
       Furthermore, DNS servers clustered behind a single service
       address (e.g., anycast or load-balancing), SHOULD use the
       same TFO server key on all instances.</t>

       <t>DNS clients MAY also enable TFO when possible.  Currently,
       on some operating systems it is not implemented or disabled by default.
       <xref target="WIKIPEDIA_TFO"/> describes applications and operating systems
       that support TFO.</t>

     </section>

     <section title="Connection Management">

       <t>Since host memory for TCP state is a finite resource, DNS
       clients and
       servers MUST actively manage their connections.  Applications
       that do not actively manage their connections
       can encounter resource exhaustion leading to denial of
       service.  For DNS, as in other protocols, there is a tradeoff
       between keeping connections open for potential future use and
       the need to free up resources for new connections that will arrive.</t>

       <t>DNS server software SHOULD provide a configurable limit
       on the total number of established TCP connections.  If the
       limit is reached, the application is expected to either close
       existing (idle) connections or refuse new connections.
       Operators SHOULD ensure the limit is configured appropriately
       for their particular situation.</t>

       <t>DNS server software MAY provide a configurable limit on
       the number of established connections per source IP address
       or subnet.  This can be used to ensure that a single or small
       set of users can not consume all TCP resources and deny
       service to other users.  Operators SHOULD ensure this limit
       is configured appropriately, based on their number of diversity
       of users.</t>

       <t>DNS server software SHOULD provide a configurable timeout
       for idle TCP connections.  For very busy name servers this
       might be set to a low value, such as a few seconds.  For
       less busy servers it might be set to a higher value, such
       as tens of seconds.  DNS clients and servers SHOULD signal
       their timeout values using the edns-tcp-keepalive
       option <xref target="RFC7828"/>.</t>

       <t>DNS server software MAY provide a configurable limit on
       the number of transactions per TCP connection. This document
       does not offer advice on particular values for such a
       limit.</t>

       <t>Similarly, DNS server software MAY provide a configurable
       limit on the total duration of a TCP connection.  This
       document does not offer advice on particular values for such
       a limit.</t>

       <t>Since clients may not be aware of server-imposed limits,
       clients utilizing TCP for DNS need to always be prepared to
       re-establish connections or otherwise retry outstanding
       queries.</t> <!-- language lifted from RFC7766 -->

     </section>

     <section title="Connection Termination">

       <t>The TCP peer that initiates a
       connection close retains the socket in the TIME_WAIT state
       for some amount of time, possibly a few minutes. 
       It is generally preferable for clients to initiate the
       close of a TCP connection so that busy servers do not 
       accumulate many sockets in the TIME_WAIT state, which can
       cause performance problems or even denial of service.
       The edns-tcp-keepalive EDNS(0) option <xref target="RFC7828"/>
       can be used to encourage clients to close connections.</t>

       <t>On systems where large numbers of sockets in TIME_WAIT
       are observed (either as client or server), it may be beneficial to tune the local TCP
       parameters.  For example, the Linux kernel provides a number
       of "sysctl" parameters related to TIME_WAIT, such as
       net.ipv4.tcp_fin_timeout and
       net.ipv4.tcp_tw_reuse.  In extreme cases, implementors and
       operators of very busy servers may find it necessary to
       utilize the SO_LINGER socket option (<xref target="Stevens"/> Section
       7.5) with a value of zero so that the server doesn't accumulate
       TIME_WAIT sockets.</t>

     </section>

     <section title="DNS-over-TLS">

       <t>DNS messages may be sent over TLS to provide privacy
       between stubs and recursive resolvers. <xref target="RFC7858"/>
       is a standards track document describing how this works.
       Although DNS-over-TLS utilizes TCP port 853 instead of port 53, this
       document applies equally well to DNS-over-TLS.  Note, however,
       DNS-over-TLS is currently only defined between stubs and
       recursives.</t>

       <t>The use of TLS places even stronger operational burdens
       on DNS clients and servers.  Cryptographic functions for
       authentication and encryption require additional processing.
       Unoptimized connection setup takes two additional round-trips
       compared to TCP, but can be reduced with TLS session
       resumption <xref target="RFC8446"/> and TLS False Start <xref
       target="RFC7918"/>.</t>

   </section>

   <section title="DNS over TCP Filtering Risks">
     <t>Networks that filter DNS over TCP risk losing access to
     significant or important pieces of the DNS namespace.  For a
     variety of reasons a DNS answer may require a DNS over TCP query.
     This may include large message sizes, lack of EDNS(0) support, DDoS
     mitigation techniques (including <xref target="RRL"/>), or perhaps some future capability that is as
     yet unforeseen will also demand TCP transport.</t>

     <t>For example, <xref target="RFC7901"/> describes a latency-avoiding
     technique that sends extra data in DNS responses.  This makes
     responses larger and potentially increases the effectiveness of DDoS reflection
     attacks.  The specification mandates the use of TCP or DNS
     Cookies <xref target="RFC7873"/>.</t>

     <t>Even if any or all particular answers have consistently been
     returned successfully with UDP in the past, this continued behavior
     cannot be guaranteed when DNS messages are exchanged between
     autonomous systems.  Therefore, filtering of DNS over TCP is
     considered harmful and contrary to the safe and successful operation
     of the Internet.  This section enumerates some of the known risks
     known at the time of this writing when networks filter DNS over
     TCP.</t>

     <section title="DNS Wedgie">
       <t>Networks that filter DNS over TCP may inadvertently cause
       problems for third-party resolvers as experienced by <xref
       target="TOYAMA"></xref>.  If, for instance, a resolver receives a
       truncated answer from a server, but when the resolver resends
       the query using TCP and the TCP response never arrives, not only
       will a complete answer be unavailable, but the resolver will incur
       the full extent of TCP retransmissions and timeouts.  This situation
       might place extreme strain on resolver resources.  If the number
       and frequency of these truncated answers are sufficiently high,
       the steady-state of lost resources as a result is a "DNS wedgie."
       A DNS wedgie is generally not easily or completely mitigated by the
       affected DNS resolver operator.</t>
     </section>

     <section title="DNS Root Zone KSK Rollover">
       <t>The plans for deploying a new root zone DNSSEC KSK highlighted
       a potential problem in retrieving the root zone key set <xref
       target="LEWIS"></xref>.  During some phases of the KSK rollover process,
       root zone DNSKEY responses were
       larger than 1280 bytes, the IPv6 minimum MTU for links
       carrying IPv6 traffic <xref target="RFC8200"/>.
       There was some concern <!-- XXX citation needed -->
       that any DNS server unable to receive large
       DNS messages over UDP, or any DNS message over TCP, would experience
       disruption while performing DNSSEC validation.</t>

       <t>However, during the
       year-long postponement of the KSK rollover there were no reported problems
       that could be attributed to the 1414 octet DNSKEY response when both
       the old and new keys were published in the zone.  Additionally, there
       were no reported problems during the two month period when the old key was
       published as revoked and the DNSKEY response was 1425 octets in size <xref target="ROLL_YOUR_ROOT"/>.</t>
     </section>

   </section>

   <section title="Logging and Monitoring">
     <t>Developers of applications that log or monitor DNS
     SHOULD NOT ignore TCP due to the perception that it is rarely used or
     is hard to process.  Operators SHOULD ensure that
     their monitoring and logging applications properly capture
     DNS message over TCP.  Otherwise, attacks, exfiltration
     attempts, and normal traffic may go undetected.</t>

     <t>DNS messages over TCP are in no way guaranteed to arrive
     in single segments.  In fact, a clever attacker might attempt
     to hide certain messages by forcing them over very small TCP
     segments.  Applications that capture network packets (e.g.,
     with libpcap <xref target="libpcap"/>) SHOULD be prepared to implement and perform full
     TCP segment reassembly.  dnscap <xref target="dnscap"/> is an
     open-source example of a DNS logging program that implements
     TCP reassembly.</t>

     <t>Developers SHOULD also keep in mind connection reuse,
     query pipelining, and out-of-order responses when building and testing
     DNS monitoring applications.</t>

     <t>As an alternative to packet capture, some DNS server software
     supports dnstap <xref target="dnstap"/> as an integrated monitoring
     protocol intended to facilitate wide-scale DNS monitoring.</t>

     <t>Ironically, returning truncated DNS over UDP answers in order
     to induce a client query to switch to DNS over TCP has become
     a common response to source address spoofed, DNS denial-of-service
     attacks <xref target="RRL"></xref>.  Historically, operators have
     been wary of TCP-based attacks, but in recent years, UDP-based
     flooding attacks have proven to be the most common protocol attack
     on the DNS.  Nevertheless, a high rate of short-lived DNS
     transactions over TCP may pose challenges.  While many operators
     have provided DNS over TCP service for many years without duress,
     past experience is no guarantee of future success.</t>

     <t>DNS over TCP is not unlike many other Internet TCP services.
     TCP threats and many mitigation strategies have been
     well-documented in a series of documents such as <xref

   <section anchor="Privacy" title="Privacy Considerations">

     <t>Since DNS over both UDP and TCP use the same underlying message
     format, the use of one transport instead of the other does not change
     the privacy characteristics of the message content (i.e., the name
     being queried). DNS over TLS or DTLS is the recommended way to
     achieve DNS privacy.</t>

     <t>Because TCP is somewhat more complex than UDP, some
     characteristics of a TCP conversation may enable fingerprinting and
     tracking that is not possible with UDP.  For example, the choice of
     initial sequence numbers, window size, and options might be able
     to identify a particular TCP implementation, or even individual
     hosts behind shared resources such as network address translators
     (NATs).</t>

   <section anchor="dnsrfcs" title="Standards Related to DNS Transport over TCP">
     <t>This section enumerates all known IETF RFC documents that are
     currently of status standard, informational, best current practice,
     or experimental and either implicitly or explicitly make
     assumptions or statements about the use of TCP as a transport for
     the DNS germane to this document.</t>

     <section title="IETF RFC 1035 - DOMAIN NAMES - IMPLEMENTATION AND SPECIFICATION">
       <t>The internet standard <xref target="RFC1035"></xref> is the
       base DNS specification that explicitly defines support for DNS
       over TCP.</t>
     </section>

     <section title="IETF RFC 1536 - Common DNS Implementation Errors and Suggested Fixes">
       <t>The informational document <xref target="RFC1536"></xref>
       states UDP is the "chosen protocol for communication though TCP
       is used for zone transfers."  That statement should now be
       considered in its historical context and is no longer a proper
       reflection of modern expectations.</t>
     </section>

     <section title="IETF RFC 1995 - Incremental Zone Transfer in DNS">
       <t>The <xref target="RFC1995"></xref> standards track document
       documents the use of TCP as the fallback transport when IXFR
       responses do not fit into a single UDP response.  As with AXFR,
       IXFR messages are typically delivered over TCP by default in
       practice.</t>
     </section>

     <section title="IETF RFC 1996 - A Mechanism for Prompt Notification of Zone Changes (DNS NOTIFY)">
       <t>The <xref target="RFC1996"></xref> standards track document
       suggests a master server may decide to issue NOTIFY messages over
       TCP.  In practice, NOTIFY messages are generally sent over UDP,
       but this specification leaves open the possibility that the
       choice of transport protocol is up to the master server, and therefore
       a slave server ought to be able to operate over both UDP and TCP.</t>
     </section>

     <section title="IETF RFC 2181 - Clarifications to the DNS Specification">
       <t>The <xref target="RFC2181"></xref> standards track document
       includes clarifying text on how a client should react to the TC
       bit set on responses.  It is advised that the response should be
       discarded and the query resent using TCP.</t>
     </section>

     <section title="IETF RFC 2694 - DNS extensions to Network Address Translators (DNS_ALG)">
       <t>The informational document <xref target="RFC2694"></xref>
       enumerates considerations for network address translation (NAT)
       devices to properly handle DNS traffic.  This document is
       noteworthy in its suggestion that
       "[t]ypically, TCP is used for AXFR requests,"
       as further evidence that helps
       explain why DNS over TCP may often have been treated very
       differently than DNS over UDP in operational networks.</t>
     </section>

     <section title="IETF RFC 3225 - Indicating Resolver Support of DNSSEC">
       <t>The <xref target="RFC3225"></xref> standards track document
       makes statements indicating DNS over TCP is "detrimental" as a
       result of increased traffic, latency, and server load.  This
       document is a companion to the next document in the RFC
       series expressing the requirement for EDNS(0) support for DNSSEC.</t>
     </section>

     <section title="IETF RFC 3326 - DNSSEC and IPv6 A6 aware server/resolver message size requirements">
       <t>Although updated by later DNSSEC RFCs,
       the standards track document <xref target="RFC3226"></xref>
       strongly argued in favor of
       UDP messages instead of TCP, largely for performance reasons.  The
       document declares EDNS(0) a requirement for DNSSEC servers and
       advocated packet fragmentation may be preferable to TCP in
       certain situations.</t>
     </section>

     <section title="IETF RFC 4472 - Operational Considerations and Issues with IPv6 DNS">
       <t>This informational document <xref target="RFC4472"></xref> notes
       that IPv6 data may increase DNS responses beyond what would fit in
       a UDP message.  Particularly noteworthy, perhaps less common today
       then when this document was written, it refers to implementations that
       truncate data without setting the TC bit to encourage the client to
       resend the query using TCP.</t>
     </section>

     <section title="IETF RFC 5452 - Measures for Making DNS More Resilient against Forged Answers">
       <t>This informational document <xref target="RFC5452"></xref> arose
       as public DNS systems began to experience widespread abuse from spoofed
       queries, resulting in amplification and reflection attacks against
       unwitting victims.  One of the leading justifications for supporting
       DNS over TCP to thwart these attacks is briefly described in this
       document's 9.3 Spoof Detection and Countermeasure section.</t>
     </section>

     <section title="IETF RFC 5507 - Design Choices When Expanding the DNS">
       <t>This informational document <xref target="RFC5507"></xref> was
       largely an attempt to dissuade new DNS data types from overloading the
       TXT resource record type.  In so doing it summarizes the conventional
       wisdom of DNS design and implementation practices.  The authors
       suggest TCP overhead and stateful properties pose challenges compared
       to UDP, and imply that UDP is generally preferred for performance and
       robustness.</t>
     </section>

     <section title="IETF RFC 5625 - DNS Proxy Implementation Guidelines">
       <t>This best current practice document <xref target="RFC5625"></xref>
       provides DNS proxy implementation guidance including the mandate that a
       proxy "MUST [...] be prepared to receive and forward queries over TCP"
       even though it suggests historically TCP transport has not been strictly
       mandatory in stub resolvers or recursive servers.</t>
     </section>

     <section title="IETF RFC 5936 - DNS Zone Transfer Protocol (AXFR)">
       <t>The <xref target="RFC5936"></xref> standards track document
       provides a detailed specification for the zone transfer protocol,
       as originally outlined in the early DNS standards.  AXFR operation
       is limited to TCP and not specified for UDP.  This document
       discusses TCP usage at length.</t>
     </section>

     <section title="IETF RFC 7534 - AS112 Nameserver Operations">
       <t><xref target="RFC7534"></xref> is an informational document
       enumerating the requirements for operation of AS112 project DNS
       servers.  New AS112 nodes are tested for their ability to provide
       service on both UDP and TCP transports, with the implication that
       TCP service is an expected part of normal operations.</t>
     </section>

     <section title="IETF RFC 6762 - Multicast DNS">
       <t>In this standards track document <xref target="RFC6762"></xref>, the
       TC bit is deemed to have essentially the same meaning as described
       in the original DNS specifications.  That is, if a response with the
       TC bit set is received, "[...] the querier SHOULD reissue its query
       using TCP in order to receive the larger response."</t>
     </section>

     <section title="IETF RFC 6891 - Extension Mechanisms for DNS (EDNS(0))">
       <t>This standards track document <xref target="RFC6891"></xref>
       helped slow the use of and need for DNS over TCP messages.  This
       document highlights concerns over server load and scalability in
       widespread use of DNS over TCP.</t>
     </section>

     <section title="IETF RFC 6950 - Architectural Considerations on Application Features in the DNS">
       <t>An informational document <xref target="RFC6950"></xref> that draws
       attention to large data in the DNS.  TCP is referenced in the
       context as a common fallback mechanism and counter to some spoofing
       attacks.</t>
     </section>

     <section title="IETF RFC 7477 - Child-to-Parent Synchronization in DNS">
       <t>This standards track document <xref target="RFC7477"></xref>
       specifies a RRType and protocol to signal and synchronize NS, A,
       and AAAA resource record changes from a child to parent zone.
       Since this protocol may require multiple requests and responses,
       it recommends utilizing DNS over TCP to ensure the conversation
       takes place between a consistent pair of end nodes.</t>
     </section>

     <section title="IETF RFC 7720 - DNS Root Name Service Protocol and Deployment Requirements">
       <t>This best current practice <xref target="RFC7720"></xref>
       declares root name service "MUST support UDP [RFC768] and TCP
       [RFC793] transport of DNS queries and responses."</t>
     </section>

     <section anchor="app-rfc7766" title="IETF RFC 7766 - DNS Transport over TCP - Implementation Requirements">
       <t>This standards track document <xref target="RFC7766"/>
       instructs DNS implementers to provide support for carrying DNS
       over TCP messages in their software, and 
       might be considered the direct ancestor of this operational
       requirements document.
       The implementation requirements document
       codifies mandatory support for DNS over TCP in compliant DNS
       software, but
       makes no recommendations to operators, which we seek to address
       here.</t>
     </section>

     <section title="IETF RFC 7828 - The edns-tcp-keepalive EDNS(0) Option">
       <t>This standards track document <xref target="RFC7828"></xref>
       defines an EDNS(0) option to negotiate an idle timeout value for
       long-lived DNS over TCP connections.  Consequently, this document
       is only applicable and relevant to DNS over TCP sessions and
       between implementations that support this option.</t>
     </section>

     <section title="IETF RFC 7858 - Specification for DNS over Transport Layer Security (TLS)">
       <t>This standards track document <xref target="RFC7858"></xref>
       defines a method for putting DNS messages into a TCP-based
       encrypted channel using TLS.  This specification is noteworthy
       for explicitly targeting the stub-to-recursive traffic, but
       does not preclude its application from recursive-to-authoritative
       traffic.</t> 
     </section>

     <section title="IETF RFC 7873 - Domain Name System (DNS) Cookies">
       <t>This standards track document <xref target="RFC7873"></xref>
       describes an EDNS(0) option to provide additional protection
       against query and answer forgery.  This specification mentions
       DNS over TCP as a reasonable fallback mechanism when DNS Cookies
       are not available.  The specification does make mention of DNS
       over TCP processing in two specific situations.  In one, when a
       server receives only a client cookie in a request, the server
       should consider whether the request arrived over TCP and if so,
       it should consider accepting TCP as sufficient to authenticate
       the request and respond accordingly.  In another, when a client
       receives a BADCOOKIE reply using a fresh server cookie, the
       client should retry using TCP as the transport.</t>
     </section>

     <section title="IETF RFC 7901 - CHAIN Query Requests in DNS">
       <t>This experimental specification <xref target="RFC7901"></xref>
       describes an EDNS(0) option that can be used by a security-aware
       validating resolver to request and obtain a complete DNSSEC
       validation path for any single query.  This document requires the
       use of DNS over TCP or a source IP address verified transport
       mechanism such as EDNS-COOKIE <xref target="RFC7873"></xref>.</t>
     </section>

     <section title="IETF RFC 8027 - DNSSEC Roadblock Avoidance">
       <t>This document <xref target="RFC8027"></xref> details observed
       problems with DNSSEC deployment and mitigation techniques.
       Network traffic blocking and restrictions, including DNS over TCP
       messages, are highlighted as one reason for DNSSEC deployment
       issues.  While this document suggests these sorts of problems are
       due to "non-compliant infrastructure" and is of type BCP, the
       scope of the document is limited to detection and mitigation
       techniques to avoid so-called DNSSEC roadblocks.</t>
     </section>

     <section title="IETF RFC 8094 - DNS over Datagram Transport Layer Security (DTLS)">
       <t>This experimental specification <xref target="RFC8094"></xref>
       details a protocol that uses a datagram transport (UDP), but
       stipulates that "DNS clients and servers that implement DNS over
       DTLS MUST also implement DNS over TLS in order to provide privacy
       for clients that desire Strict Privacy [...]."  This requirement
       implies DNS over TCP must be supported in case the message size
       is larger than the path MTU.</t>
     </section>

     <section title="IETF RFC 8162 - Using Secure DNS to Associate Certificates with Domain Names for S/MIME">
       <t>This experimental specification <xref target="RFC8162"></xref>
       describes a technique to authenticate user X.509 certificates
       in an S/MIME system via the DNS.  The document points out that
       the new experimental resource record types are expected to carry
       large payloads, resulting in the suggestion that "applications
       SHOULD use TCP -- not UDP -- to perform queries for the SMIMEA
       resource record."</t>

     <section title="IETF RFC 8467 - Padding Policies for Extension Mechanisms for DNS (EDNS(0))">
       <t>An experimental document <xref target="RFC8467"></xref>
       reminds implementers to consider the underlying transport
       protocol (e.g. TCP) when calculating the padding length when
       artificially increasing the DNS message size with an EDNS(0)
       padding option.</t>
     </section>

     <section title="IETF RFC 8482 - Providing Minimal-Sized Responses to DNS Queries That Have QTYPE=ANY">
       <t><xref target="RFC8482"/> is a standards-track document that
       describes alternative ways that DNS servers can respond to queries
       of type ANY, which are somtimes used to provide amplification
       in DDoS attacks.  The specification notes that responders may
       behave differently, depending on the transport.  For example,
       mimimal-sized responses may be used over UDP transport, while
       full responses may be given over TCP.</t>

     <section title="IETF RFC 8483 - Yeti DNS Testbed">
       <t>This informational document <xref target="RFC8483"></xref>

       behaviors, including issues involving packet fragmentation and
       operational requirements for TCP stream assembly in order to
       conduct DNS measurement and analysis.</t>

     <section title="IETF RFC 8484 - DNS Queries over HTTPS (DoH)">
       <t>This standards track document <xref target="RFC8484"></xref>
       defines a protocol for sending DNS queries and responses over
       HTTPS.  This specification assumes TLS and TCP for the underlying
       security and transport layers, respectively.  Self-described as a
       a technique that more closely resembles a tunneling mechanism,
       DoH nevertheless likely implies DNS over TCP in some sense, if not
       directly.</t>

     <section title="IETF RFC 8490 - DNS Stateful Operations">
       <t>This standards track document <xref target="RFC8490"></xref>
       updates the base protocol specification with a new OPCODE to
       help manage stateful operations in persistent sessions, such
       as those that might be used by DNS over TCP.</t>

     <section title="IETF RFC 8501 - Reverse DNS in IPv6 for Internet Service Providers">
       <t>This informational document <xref target="RFC8501"></xref>
       identifies potential operational challenges with Dynamic DNS
       including denial-of-service threats.  The document suggests TCP
       may provide some advantages, but that updating hosts would need
       to be explicitly configured to use TCP instead of UDP.</t>
